State Management: useReducer is a React hook used for managing state in functional components. It is an alternative to useState, especially for managing complex state logic.

Reducer Function: When using useReducer, you provide a reducer function and an initial state. The reducer function takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns the new state based on the action.

Predictable State Updates: Reducers enforce predictability in state updates. The state transition logic is centralized within the reducer function, making it easier to understand and maintain complex state logic.

Action Dispatch: To update the state managed by useReducer, you dispatch actions. An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes the type of update you want to perform on the state.

Immutability: Like with useState, state updates with useReducer are immutable. You should not mutate the state directly within the reducer function. Instead, return a new state object.

Complex State Logic: useReducer is particularly useful for managing state that involves complex logic or multiple related values. It allows you to encapsulate this logic within the reducer function, improving code organization and readability.

Global State Management: useReducer can also be used for global state management in React applications. By combining it with the Context API, you can create powerful state management solutions.

Performance Considerations: While useReducer is a powerful tool, be mindful of its performance implications, especially for components with frequent state updates. In some cases, useState may be more efficient for simpler state management needs.

Use Cases: Common use cases for useReducer include managing form state, handling complex UI interactions, implementing undo/redo functionality, and more.

Comparison with useState: Although useReducer and useState can accomplish similar tasks, useReducer is often preferred for managing complex state or when state logic needs to be shared between multiple components.
