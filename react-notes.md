React is a Javascript library 
A JS library is a collection of functions to simplify development and to introdue powerful features and functionality 
React reconsilation algorithm is known as react fiber
At the heart of react is the concept of declarative programmning
React uses the concept of state which essentially describe the content of the interface
Whenever the state is changed the interface automatically updates to reflect the change
In terms of react fiber when the state changes the new virtual dom tree is generated and comapred with previous version in the process called diffing, the computed difference is then applied to the real dom
React gives you the abilty to breakdown the huge interface into components
components are resuable and composable
componenets are true building blocks of React 
Everything you build with react is esstenially known as components
componenets can receive the data using props
