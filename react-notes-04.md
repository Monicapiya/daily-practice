Fragments
It lets you render multiple sibling elements on top level without need of encloing DOM node
React Components can only render ONLY ONE ROOT element in a component
Fragments do not render any extra wrapper in the DOM but enables react components multiple sibling nodes easily
The short hand fragments operator <> </> doesnot permit attributes/props. Use <Fragment> when the key attribute needs to be set. 
only key attribute is permitted at this time
DOM Nodes means as per HTML DOM standard, everything in an HTML document is a node
