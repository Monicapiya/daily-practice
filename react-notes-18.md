Single Page Applications (SPAs)

SPA is an application that loads a single HTML page and all the necessary assets (JavaScript and CSS) required for the application to run. 

Any interactions with the page or subsequent pages does not require a round trip to the server which means reloading of page is not required

How Routing takes place in a Single Page Application (SPAs)

Client- side routing

Client- side routing is a process which maps & syncs URLs with UIs in an otherwise single page JavaScript app.

A URL is made up of the protocol which would typically be “https” for a secured site, the host name or the domain name in this case, followed by the path name and optional query string parameters. 

For client-side routing in a single page app, we need to somehow change and track the path name without actually navigating away from the page. The path name can thus be customized.  

React Router

React Router, an open source routing library which has grown to become a standard library for implementing routing in a React application. 

Built by Michael Jackson & Ryan Florence, React Router is an outstanding and feature rich routing library that is easy to use and packs enough firepower for the stickiest of routing challenges. 

React Router features :

Internally abstracts & uses the History API for consistent behavior across all browsers

Whenever the URL changes, it re-renders the app.
